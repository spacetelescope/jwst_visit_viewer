Example JWST visit files, produced mostly in the course of wavefront rehearsals, team practices, and launch rehearsal exercises. 

The current set of examples is mostly OTE and WFSC focused. 

Note, JWST visit files are considered public information. (Not in most cases of much interest to the broader public, but these are *not* restricted data products based on ST mission office guidance.)
